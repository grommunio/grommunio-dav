## Development environment setup

To set up a development environment, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/grommunio/grommunio-dav
   ```

2. Install up to a working setup (nginx, php-fpm).

3. After creation (or modification) of code modifying core structures, the included autoload code (composer2) should be updated as well.

   ```sh
   curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
   php composer.phar dump-autoload -o
   ```

4. After creation (or modification) of code, make sure your code follows the repositories coding style.

   ```sh
   composer require --working-dir=tools/php-cs-fixer friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer
   tools/php-cs-fixer/vendor/friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer/php-cs-fixer --config=.phpcs fix ./
   ```

5. Validation of correct setup is possible by pointing a browser to https://<URL>/dav which should require to authenticate with valid credentials. The message "GET not supported" after successful authentication is correct, since EAS does not operate on HTTP GET.

6. Validation of development environment is best when at least a mobile device account is successfully connected.
